# PRPL with Custom Elements and Firebase (Urdish)

This repository is a container for this codelab [PRPL with Custom Elements and Firebase](https://prpl-ce-firebase-urdish.firebaseapp.com/#0) in urdish (Roman-Urdu using English alphabets, as we call it).

The original codelab can be seen [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/prpl-ce-firebase/) and the code used in these codelabs resides [here](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/prpl-ce-firebase/blob/master/README.md).

In this codelab, youâ€™ll learn how to build a web app with Custom Elements that implements the PRPL pattern and deploy to Firebase Hosting (explained in urdish).
